This file contains the files to run the Wifi design that we eventually excluded from our design.

master_reader was uploaded to the nodeMCU
slave_sender was uploaded to the arduinoDUE
testSampleRate was used to test the transfer rate of the design by printing values to the serial monitor
sendData was used to transfer values to the server via only the nodeMCU
